# Post Office Online Shipping System

## Project Overview

**Domain:** Post Office Online Shipping System  

**Purpose:**  
This system allows customers to prepare parcels or letters before going to the post office. Users can register, create shipping transactions, pay online, and print a shipping label. The label can be attached to the parcel or letter before dropping it off at a post office box or service location.

---

## Main Features

- Customer registration with identity verification  
  (upload national ID card and photo holding the ID)

- Account approval process by post office staff

- Customer login using email and password

- Create shipping orders by selecting parcel type, size, and weight

- Enter receiver information and delivery location

- Automatic price calculation for shipping services

### Electronic Payment Methods
- Mobile banking (PromptPay)
- Credit card
- E-wallet (e.g., TrueMoney Wallet)

- Generate a **PDF shipping label** containing sender and receiver details and a QR code for parcel tracking

- Customers can track parcel status using a tracking number

- Optional insurance for valuable items

### Administrative Dashboard
Post office staff can:

- Monitor number of parcels per **day, week, and month**
- View revenue reports
- Generate **formatted PDF reports** for management

---

## System Requirements

- High availability with **99.999% uptime**
- Fast response time (pages should respond within **1 second**)
- Strong security to protect sensitive information such as national ID and payment data
- Data encryption for **database storage and network transmission**
- System theme follows **Thailand Post design (white and red)**

---

## Architecture

The project is separated into two main parts:

### Backend

**Node.js + Express**

Provides REST API services and handles database operations.

### Frontend

**React / Web Interface**

Provides user interfaces for customers and staff to interact with the system.

# Getting Started — Run Locally
 
## Prerequisites
 
Make sure you have the following installed before getting started:
 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
 
---
 
## 1. Clone the Repository
 
Open a terminal and run:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ICT-Mahidol/2025-ITCS383-Arai-Kor-Dai.git
cd 2025-ITCS383-Arai-Kor-Dai
```
 
---
 
## 2. Run the Backend
 
Open a terminal, navigate to the backend folder, install dependencies, and start the server:
 
```bash
cd implementations/backend
npm install
node server.js
```
 
The backend server should now be running. Keep this terminal open.
 
---
 
## 3. Run the Frontend (React)
 
Open a **second terminal**, navigate to the frontend folder, install dependencies, and start the dev server:
 
```bash
cd implementations/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
 
Your browser should automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`.
 
---

## Troubleshooting
 
- **Port already in use** — If you see `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)`, simply press `Y` to run on the next available port, or free up the port and restart.
- **`npm` not found** — Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first; npm is included.
- **Backend not connecting** — Ensure the backend terminal is still running before starting the frontend.
- Log in to the system
- Access parcel services
